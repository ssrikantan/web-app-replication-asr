This article deals with:
With Azure Site Recovery (ASR) it is now possible to orchestrate fail over of workloads like Web Applications running Azure Virtual Machines from a Primary Site to a DR Site. Using Recovery Plans and Runbook Automation, one could script specific configuration actions on the Compute resources that have been recovered by ASR, and bring the Application live on the DR Site. Recovery Services Vault in ASR also provides the ability to simulate and test a Fail over scenario.
